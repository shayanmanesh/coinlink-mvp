IMPORTANT: Take your time with these changes. I need production-ready, fully functional implementations with attention to design quality and user experience.

Requirements:
1. Complete all functionality - no placeholders or partial implementations
2. Ensure proper error handling and edge cases
3. Focus on clean, professional UI/UX design
4. Test features before marking complete
5. Ask clarifying questions if requirements are unclear

Do NOT rush through tasks. I'd rather have fewer features done perfectly than many done partially.

Confirm you understand these quality expectations before proceeding.
