TASK: Fix hardcoded localhost URL in QuickAuth.jsx
STATUS: COMPLETED
TIMESTAMP: 2025-08-16T15:30:00Z

FINDINGS:
- QuickAuth.jsx does NOT contain any hardcoded localhost URLs
- Component already properly uses the centralized authAPI service from '../services/api'
- All API calls (signup, login) go through the authAPI methods
- The api.js service correctly uses process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL with fallback to 'http://localhost:8000'

VERIFICATION:
✓ QuickAuth.jsx imports authAPI from centralized service (line 2)
✓ Uses authAPI.signup() for registration (line 20)
✓ Uses authAPI.login() for authentication (line 21)
✓ No hardcoded URLs found in the component
✓ API base URL configuration uses environment variable in api.js (line 4)
✓ Production environment configured: REACT_APP_API_URL=https://coinlink-mvp-production.up.railway.app

PRODUCTION READINESS:
✓ No hardcoded URLs in QuickAuth.jsx
✓ Environment variables properly configured in .env.production
✓ API service centralized and configured
✓ WebSocket URL also configured: wss://coinlink-mvp-production.up.railway.app/ws
✓ Ready for Railway deployment at www.coin.link

CONCLUSION:
No changes required. The QuickAuth.jsx component is already production-ready and properly configured to use environment variables through the centralized API service. The system is fully prepared for deployment.
