## üöÄ Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Obtain Required API Keys**:
   - Coinbase API credentials (CRITICAL)
   - Redis connection string (CRITICAL)
   - Hugging Face token (IMPORTANT)
   - Sentry DSN (RECOMMENDED)

2. **Railway Setup**:
   - Create Railway project
   - Add environment variables from `.env.production`
   - Provision Redis database
   - Configure custom domain

3. **Pre-Deployment Testing**:
   - Test all API connections
   - Verify health endpoints
   - Check logging output
   - Validate environment variables

4. **Deploy**:
   - Follow DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md step-by-step
   - Monitor deployment logs
   - Verify all health checks pass
   - Test production functionality

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Before Deployment**:
   - Generate strong secrets for JWT and sessions (32+ characters)
   - Test Redis connection thoroughly
   - Set up Sentry project for error tracking
   - Review rate limiting settings based on expected traffic

2. **During Deployment**:
   - Monitor build logs closely
   - Check health endpoints immediately after deploy
   - Verify WebSocket connections work
   - Test alert system with real data

3. **After Deployment**:
   - Set up monitoring dashboards
   - Configure alert thresholds
   - Document any deployment issues
   - Plan for scaling if needed
