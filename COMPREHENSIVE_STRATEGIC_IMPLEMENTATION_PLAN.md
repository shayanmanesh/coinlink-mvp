- Implement retry logic and error handling from day one

### Risk 3: Scope Creep (CRITICAL)
**Risk**: Adding features beyond core MVP requirements
**Likelihood**: Very High (90%)
**Impact**: Critical (timeline failure)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Ruthless prioritization: defer all non-essential features
- Weekly scope review meetings with strict change control
- Success criteria focused on replacing simulation, not adding features

### Risk 4: Revenue Model Validation (MEDIUM)
**Risk**: Implemented revenue model doesn't match market needs
**Likelihood**: Medium (40%)
**Impact**: High (business model failure)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Customer development interviews during Week 1-4
- Iterative pricing model testing with early users
- Revenue model validation before full production launch

**Principle**: Replace simulation incrementally, not wholesale
**Method**: 
- Identify smallest viable unit of simulated functionality
- Implement real replacement with proper testing
- Validate improvement before moving to next component
- Maintain system stability throughout transition

#### 2. Risk-Based Prioritization
**Principle**: Address highest-risk simulations first

- Go/No-Go decisions at each validation point

### Quality Assurance Framework

#### Definition of Done (DoD) Criteria
Every implementation task must meet:
1. **Functionality**: Real business logic (no simulation)
2. **Testing**: Unit tests and integration tests
3. **Documentation**: API documentation and user guides
