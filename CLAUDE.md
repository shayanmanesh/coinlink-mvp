CoinLink, a multi-modal, multi-agent system for financial trading that coordinates specialized LLM-based agents to interpret financial data and generate investment strategies. CoinLink processes textual news, candlestick charts, and trading signal charts to produce high-quality financial reports, while also enabling modification of reports and investment recommendations through data-driven user interaction and question answering. A central reflection module analyzes historical trading signals and outcomes to continuously refine decision processes, and the system is capable of real-time report analysis, summarization, and dynamic adjustment of investment strategies. Empirical results confirm that CoinLink systematically enriches technical price triggers with contextual macroeconomic and capital flow signals, providing a more interpretable, robust, and actionable investment framework that improves returns and strengthens investor confidence.

CoinLink consists of four core modules:
1.	User Interface (UI) features an intelligent conversational AI agent as the primary interface, where users can engage in natural dialogue to receive proactive alerts, configure preferences through simple conversation, and request real-time system insights on demand. The AI agent serves as an expert guide, interpreting user intent and presenting complex monitoring data through clear, contextual responses.
2.	Core Business Logic handles multi-agent report generation, price forecasting, and news-driven recommendation services. Implements Trajectory-Aided Reasoning (arXiv:2505.19815) to analyze historical trading decision paths for improved future predictions, Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO) (arXiv:2506.07160) to coordinate specialized agents through contrastive learning, and Policy Discriminative Learning (POLAR) Framework (arXiv:2507.05197) to distinguish between high and low-performing investment strategies across market conditions.
3.	AI Engine includes LLM-based reasoning agents, real-time retrieval modules, graph-based RAG components, and ML-based predictive models.
4.	Database Layer integrates data from exchanges, news aggregators, and on-chain metrics, storing structured outputs like predictions and reports.

System Design:
Coinlink is a modular and extensible framework for quantitative investment analysis. It addresses performance challenges by integrating diverse data sources, real-time market data, and news sentiment into a unified AI-driven decision making pipeline.
