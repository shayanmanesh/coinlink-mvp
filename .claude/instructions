IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS:
* Begin by asking qualifying questions *
- One-shot implementation - get it right the first time
- Use REAL API data only - no hardcoded examples
- Test ALL features before claiming completion
- Verify with console output or browser screenshots
- Ask questions BEFORE implementing if unclear
- Test again, ensuring production-ready code and following design best practices.

FORBIDDEN:
* Begin by asking qualifying questions *
- Claiming "complete" without proof
- Placeholder data or mock values
- Multiple attempts at the same feature
- Progress reports without working code
- Partial implementations
- Test again, ensuring production-ready code and following design best practices.


WORKFLOW:
* Begin by asking qualifying questions *
1. Understand requirement fully
2. Implement completely
3. Test thoroughly
4. Show proof of functionality
5. Only then report completion


Quality > Speed. Production-ready code only.
